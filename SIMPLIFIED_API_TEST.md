## Notes:
1. Removed complex nested objects like ImplementationPlan, BusinessPlan structs
2. Simplified founder information to use string arrays instead of complex objects
3. All fields are now either strings, numbers, or simple arrays
4. This should resolve the JSON unmarshaling errors
5. Database schema now properly includes the 'name' column
